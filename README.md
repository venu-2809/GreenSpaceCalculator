# GreenSpaceCalculator üåçüå≤

GreenSpaceCalculator is a Python tool designed to estimate the number of trees that can be planted in a specified area. By leveraging satellite imagery and geocoding services, this project identifies available plantable spaces, calculates areas, and provides a visual map highlighting suitable locations for tree planting.

## Overview
GreenSpaceCalculator aims to support environmental sustainability and reforestation efforts by calculating plantable spaces within a defined area. It uses the Mapbox API for satellite imagery, OpenCage for geocoding, and OpenCV for image processing to create a visual guide for potential tree planting locations and provides an estimated count of trees that can be planted based on free space.

## Features
- **Location-based Analysis**: Input an area name to retrieve satellite imagery and calculate plantable area.
- **Tree Count Estimation**: Utilizes image segmentation to calculate potential tree planting areas and estimate the number of trees.
- **Visual Map Highlights**: Outputs an image with highlighted areas indicating suitable tree planting zones.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GreenSpaceCalculator.git
cd GreenSpaceCalculator
pip install -r requirements.txt
